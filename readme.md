# HEIC to JPEG Converter

A simple and lightweight executable for converting `.heic` files to `.jpg`.

## Description

During a flight/travel, driven by the frustration of not finding an efficient free tool, I wrote this program to convert .heic images to .jpg. Simply place it in a directory with .heic files, and on execution, it will save the converted .jpg images in a "jpegs" subfolder. It's written  with concurrency and multi-threading for optimized performance.

## Features

- Converts `.heic` files to `.jpg` format.
- Automatically detects `.heic` files in a target directory (or a single file path).
- Saves the converted `.jpg` files in a dedicated subfolder.
- Extremely fast, utilizing multi-threading and concurrency.
- Provides a log file with details of the conversion. 

## Usage

1. Download the executable(.exe) in the repo.
2. Run the executable with an optional first argument:
   - No argument: processes the current directory.
   - Directory path: processes all `.heic` files in that directory.
   - File path: processes that single `.heic` file.
3. Check the `jpegs` subfolder in the target directory for the converted `.jpg` images.


## Sample Output

Here's a snippet from a typical `logs.txt` generated by the program:
```shell
.
.
.
IMG_0267.HEIC==IMG_0267.HEIC 1.2MB > Converted > jpegs/IMG_0267.jpg 1.0MB
IMG_0719.HEIC==IMG_0719.HEIC 977.9KB > Converted > jpegs/IMG_0719.jpg 953.0KB

325 Files 
Total time taken: 27s 220ms
Average time per file: 0s 83ms

Total HEIC files size: 311.0MB
Total JPEG folder size: 280.4MB
