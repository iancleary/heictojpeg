# HEIC to JPEG Converter

A simple and lightweight executable for converting `.heic` files to `.jpg`.

## Description

This project converts `.heic` images to `.jpg` and writes the results to a `jpegs` subfolder. It is designed to process batches quickly using concurrency.

## Features

- Converts `.heic` files to `.jpg` format.
- Supports three input modes:
  - no argument (current directory)
  - path to a directory (all `.heic` files in that directory)
  - path to a single file (just that file)
- Saves the converted `.jpg` files in a dedicated subfolder.
- Extremely fast, utilizing multi-threading and concurrency.
- Provides a log file with details of the conversion. 

## Installation

### Option 1: Build from source (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iancleary/heictojpeg.git
cd heictojpeg
go build -o heictojpeg .
```

### Option 2: Install with Go

```bash
go install github.com/iancleary/heictojpeg@latest
```

### Option 3: Download a release binary

If release assets are available, download the binary for your OS from the GitHub Releases page and run it directly.

## Usage

1. Run the executable with an optional first argument:
   - No argument: process `.heic` files in the current directory.
   - Directory path: process all `.heic` files in that directory.
   - File path: process only that `.heic` file.
2. Check the `jpegs` subfolder in the target directory for converted `.jpg` images.


## Sample Output

Here's a snippet from a typical `logs.txt` generated by the program:
```shell
